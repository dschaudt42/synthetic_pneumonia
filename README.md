# synthetic_pneumonia
Code repository for our paper "A critical assessment of generative models for synthetic data augmentation on limited pneumonia X-ray data". We provide our code for classification model trainings and evaluation in /source. Diffusion model training is based on the [Hugging Face diffusers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index).
